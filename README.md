# Tasca-S1.1. Responsive HTML and CSS Flex Layout

This task is designed to help you create a responsive layout that seamlessly adapts to desktop, mobile, and tablet devices using HTML and CSS Flexbox. Ensure you are equipped with the following knowledge to make the most of this exercise:

## Objectives
Understand and practice HTML and CSS.
Learn how to create small CSS animations.
Understand how MediaQueries work.

## Prerequisite Knowledge:

### HTML and CSS Flexbox:

Refer to the [Flexbox CSS: Complete Guide, Elements, and Examples](https://www.aluracursos.com/blog/flexbox-css-guia-completo-elementos-y-ejemplos) for comprehensive insights into Flexbox usage.

### Media Queries:

Utilize media queries with breakpoints similar to Bootstrap for responsive design.
Explore [Media Queries](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/#media-queries) for guidance on setting up breakpoints.

## Important Considerations:

1. **Avoid Heightening Layers:**
   - Layers should adapt to their content; avoid unnecessarily increasing height.
   - Exceptions: Heightening is acceptable when a layer has no content.

2. **Prevent Horizontal Scroll Bar:**
   - Ensure the page doesn't have a horizontal scrollbar.
   - Use browser inspection to identify wider blocks causing this issue.

3. **Nested Divs and Display Property:**
   - Understand that within a div, there are often nested divs.
   - By default, divs have `display: block`, causing them to stack vertically.
   - Redundant styles like `display: flex; flex-direction: column` might not be necessary.

4. **Width of Divs:**
   - Note that by default, the width of a div is the entirety of the wrapping layer.
   - Usually, specifying `width: 100%` is unnecessary.

## Practice Guidelines:

- Develop a responsive layout catering to desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
- Apply Flexbox principles for efficient and flexible design.
- Employ media queries for responsive breakpoints.
- Address common issues mentioned above for optimal results.

**Happy coding!** ðŸš€
